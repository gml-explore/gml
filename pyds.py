        method and yields a better Monte-Carlo approximation in case of normalization.
        
        'likelihoods' specifies the conditional plausibilities for a set of singleton hypotheses.

        'normalization' determines whether the resulting mass function is normalized, i.e., whether m({}) == 0.
        If 'sample_count' is not None, the true mass function is approximated using the specified number of samples.

        Generate a mass function from an empirical probability distribution that was obtained from a limited number of samples.
        This makes the expected deviation of the empirical distribution from the true distribution explicit.
        
        'histogram' represents the empirical distribution. It is a dictionary mapping each possible event to the respective
        number of observations (represented as integers).
        
        'method' determines the algorithm used for generating the mass function.
        Except for method 'bayesian', all algorithms are based on the idea that the true probabilities lie within confidence intervals
        represented by the mass function with confidence level 1 - 'alpha'.
        
        The following modes are supported:
        
        'idm': Imprecise Dirichlet model. A small amount of mass (controlled by 's') is assigned to the entire frame.
        For more information on 'idm', see:
        P. Walley (1996), "Inferences from multinomial data: learning about a bag of marbles",
        Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological), 3-57.
        
        'maxbel': Maximize the total belief by solving a linear program. (Attention: this becomes very computationally expensive
        for larger numbers of events.)
        
        'maxbel-ordered': Similar to 'maxbel' except that the events are assumed to have a natural order (e.g., intervals), in which case
        the mass function can be computed analytically and thus much faster.
        
        For more information on 'maxbel' and 'maxbel-ordered', see:
        T. Denoeux (2006), "Constructing belief functions from sample data using multinomial confidence regions",
        International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 42, 228-252.
        
        'mcd': Compute the least committed consonant mass function whose pignistic transformation lies within the confidence interval
        induced by 'alpha'. Like 'maxbel', it is based on solving a linear program and quickly becomes computationally expensive.
        
        'mcd-approximate': An approximation of 'mcd' that can be computed much more efficiently.
        
        For more information on these two methods, see:
        A. Aregui, T. Denoeux (2008), "Constructing consonant belief functions from sample data using confidence sets of pignistic probabilities",
        International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 49, 575-594.
        
        'bayesian': Construct a Bayesian mass function based on the relative frequencies. In addition, additive smoothing is applied (controlled by 's'). 
        
        In case the sample number is 0, returns a vacuous mass function (or uniform distribution for 'bayesian').
